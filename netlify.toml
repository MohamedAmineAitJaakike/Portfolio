# Notes:
# - Use Git-based deploys (Import from Git) so Netlify can run the build and plugin.
# - Drag-and-drop of a static folder is supported only for fully static sites (next export -> out), but this project uses the Next.js app router and dynamic features,
#   so drag-and-drop is not recommended unless you explicitly export a reduced/static version.
